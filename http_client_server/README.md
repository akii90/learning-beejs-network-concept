# Http Client and Server

Client: A socket program that can download files from a web server!

Server: A simple web server, it will be able to handle requests from the web client we write...or indeed any other web client such as Chrome

## Restrictions
In order to better understand the sockets API at a lower level, this project may not use any of the following
helper functions:
- The `socket.create_connection()` function.
- The `socket.create_server()` function.
- Anything in the `urllib` modules.
